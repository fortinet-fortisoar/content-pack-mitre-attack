2. Navigate to **MITRE ATT&CK** > **Mitigation** to view a list of mitigation measures in place.
    - Click a *Mitigation* measure to view more information about it
    - Under the tab **Related Records** you can check the following tabs
        - **Techniques** - Lists the techniques that the selected mitigation method addresses
